    <h1>Welcome the to the GPA and Grade Calculator!</h1>

    <p>
    This page was created to help college students to be able to calculate their GPA and grades.
    I noticed that non-traditional students as well as students who struggled with math had
    a hard time figuring out what their grades were for individual classes. Most of them
    also did not know or understand how to calculate a GPA. So as I went from one programming
    class to another I decided to create something that would help the other students
    calculate their grades and a GPA.
